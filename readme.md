# MFM Atlas Scientific Module x2

This sensor module carries a Atlas-Scientific EZO-EC board and isolates and multiplexes the signal line to two SMA connectors for probes.

This sensor module contains a USB-C port for easier configuration and calibration of the different probes. This also allows the module to be used standalone in an ESD protected environment.
